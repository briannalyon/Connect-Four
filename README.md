# Connect Four
Connect Four is a two-player connection board game, in which the players choose a color and then take turns dropping colored discs into a seven-column, six-row vertically suspended grid. The pieces fall straight down, occupying the lowest avaiable space within the column. The objective of the game is to be the first to form a horizontal, vertical, or diagonal line of four of one's own discs. 

## Rules of the Game
1. Players must alternate turns and only one disc can be dropped in each turn.
2. On your turn, select any of the seven columns that you would like to drop your colored disc in.
3. The game ends when there is a 4-in-a-row or a stalemate.
